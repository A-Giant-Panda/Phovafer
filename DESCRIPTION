Description: This package is developed for the project "Analytical Middleware for Informed Distribution Networks (AMIDiNe)" (EPSRC Reference: EP/S030131/1) by the aim of identifying the solar photovoltaic (PV) users among the regular consumers in the low-voltage network. It contains the R functions for data representation, feature extraction, and PV users' classification using the extracted features. It is associated with the working manuscript "Ge, D., Hu, M., Telford, R., Stephen, B., & Wallom, D. (2020). Automated Quantification of PV Penetration on Unmonitored Distribution Network Feeders."
